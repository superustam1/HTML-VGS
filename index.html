    <h1>Round earth</h1>
    <p>The earth is round. This is a known fact yet there exist people that dont believe it.
        I dont understand how anyone could believe otherwise. There is tons of evidence for
        the earth being round and there is absolutely zero evidence for a flat earth. They say
        "Well if the earth was round, why doesnt anyone fall of when they get to the bottom of the earth?"
        We dont fall of because gravity exists. There is no true up or down, we just get dragged
        by gravity towards the center of the earth. They also say "If the earth is spinning, why
        dont we feel it?" Because we cant feel speed, we can only feel acceleration and deceleration.
        The speed of the earth spinning never changes. If you dont believe it please click the link
        to the video at the bottom.
