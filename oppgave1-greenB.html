    <h1>Brawl stars</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite game right now is brawl stars. I like the game because
        it's really accesible, is free and doesn't lag much. I love the amount
        of characters, and lore this game has. I've been playing it since it
        got released globally in 2017. Of course i haven't been playing everyday
        since then and i've taken quite a few long breaks but i still love the game.

    <h1>Gameplay</h1>
    <p>The game is a shooter but neither from first person nor third person. The game
        is played in a birds eye view. You move your character with a blue joy stick and
        you shoot with a red joystick. There are many gamemodes that change every season.
        But the most popular ones are gem grab, brawl ball, showdown, bounty, heist, hotzone and knockout.
        All of the gamemodes except showdown and duels (which isnt always availible) are 3v3 modes.
        Meaning you play in a team against another team.
